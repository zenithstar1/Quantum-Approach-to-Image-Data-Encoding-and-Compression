# Quantum-Approach-to-Image-Data-Encoding-and-Compression
Encoding image data using quantum techniques like basic, amplitude and phase to improve data management and security, utilizing IBM Qiskit to implement superposition and entanglement in quantum algorithms, compressing the image data by 75% for better storage, using QCT1 technique
